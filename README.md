# Memory-game
This is a classic memory game where the player is challenged to recall which image has changed among the amount of pictures he has chosen. The pictures appear on the screen and then disappear. If the guess is correct, the pictures will disappear again and the player will have to guess again. 

The objective is to remember the sequence of images and identify the changing picture each time. This game tests and improves the player's memory and observation skills.

## How to Play
The player has to guess which one has changed by clicking on it.
